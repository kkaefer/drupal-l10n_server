"The local package connector for localization community looks at a "
"local directory and handles packages you upload there, making them "
"available for localization on the web interface. Set up the properties "
"of that directory here. The <a href=\"@scan_link\">Scan tab</a> allows "
"you to initiate a manual scan on files in the directory, but it is "
"advised to set up cron to check for new packages periodically."

"The directory on the local file system to be scanned for packages. "
"Either relative to the Drupal site root or an absolute path on your "
"file system. Drupal should have read access to the files and "
"directories found there. Projects are identified based on subdirectory "
"names or the first part of filenames if put directly in the root "
"directory. Releases are identified based on the second part of package "
"filenames. Examples: Drupal/drupal-6.0.tar.gz is from project "
"\"Drupal\" in version 6.0, while og-5.x-2.0-alpha1 is project \"og\" "
