ABOUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The localization server project (formerly known as lt_server) provides a 
community localization editor, which allows people from around the world to 
collaborate on translating projects to different languages, especially for 
Drupal. It is inspired by Launchpad Rosetta (https://launchpad.net/rosetta) 
but is highly adapted to Drupal needs.

The module suite solves the Drupal project translation problem with a web
based interface. The various Drupal projects release source code on a daily
basis. The goal is to help translators to keep up with this pace by sharing
already translated strings and distributing translations effectively.

The localization server module suite consists of two modules:

 - l10n_server: Scans Drupal projects for translatable strings and stores
   these in the database. The translations are syndicated to sites
   running l10n_client.module (in a separate project) using an RSS-like
   XML format with translation updates.
   
 - l10n_community: A translation community interface using "Organic
   Groups" module to handle the teams.

A copy of this module suite runs on http://drupal.titanatlas.com, so you 
can test and contribute to translations.

INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- You must have PHP 5.2.2 or later (older versions eat a lot more memory),
  and your PHP must have zzlib support, and should allow file copying.
- Locale (built into Drupal) and Organic Groups
  (http://drupal.org/project/og) modules are required.

1. Enable both modules at Administer > Site configuration > Modules.
2. Config the server at Administer > Site configuration > Localization Server.

HOW DOES IT WORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The localization server scans new/updated projects for new strings on every
cron run. Manual scan of projects is possible by going to Administer > Site
configuration > Localization Server and clicking on "Update strings now".

This module comsumes a huge amount of resources. It downloads each project
package from drupal.org, extracts their contents and scans them for translatable
strings. Lots of hard disk space and memory is required. This is why the module
is preconfigured to scan only one project at a time. Big projects like
E-Commerce or Drupal itself take some time to parse.

The localization community module couples the server with translation team
capabilities relying on Organic Groups. Group members can suggest new
translations for strings, maintainers can even decide on the official
translation based on the different suggestions. To translate a module, go
to Translation Status, choose a language and choose the module. There you
can translate all strings.

DEVELOPERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module suite is in heavy development now. Better cooperation with existing
modules and more interoperability functions are planned. The goal is to have
this module suire as the official translation interface for Drupal modules.
We take pride by coding to Drupal, PHP E_ALL and E_STRICT coding standards,
as well as XHTML Strict and CSS 2 compliance.
